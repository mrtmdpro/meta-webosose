# Summary

This layer is a collection of recipes and bbclasses we needed to backport
from newer oe-core to our build which is using older release.

The aim of this layer is to be able to just remove it from BBLAYERS when we
upgrade oe-core instead of removing individual files from our other layers.

If you're looking for backports from dylan to danny, check danny branch.
If you're looking for backports from dora to dylan, check dylan branch.
If you're looking for backports from daisy to dora, check dora branch.
If you're looking for backports from dizzy to daisy, check daisy branch.
