Subject: [PATCH] Don't send synthetic hover event on a frame update

This reverts the commit 6f84a09 partially which generates a synthetic
hover event on a frame update. Such hover event has never been expected
in webOS and messes up the existing logic.

Change-Id: I7b855d27d1d44f2fab240707ef1ec79cdbcff6e5
Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [webOS specific]
